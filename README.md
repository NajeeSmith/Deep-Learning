# Deep-Learning
A compilation of the various deep learning projects I have created in my AI journey.
This repository contains (or will contain) processes such as: Artificial Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing. This also contains linear transformation techniques such as PCA and LDA. Despite my excitement over LDA, hence reflective naming, I understand that instances with small samples would favor the use of unsupervised learning. Grid search was also employed for parameter tuning and optimization.
