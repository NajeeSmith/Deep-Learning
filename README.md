# Deep-Learning
A compilation of the various deep learning projects I have created in my AI journey.
This repository contains (or will contain) processes such as: artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, self-organizing maps, and boltzman machines.  This also contains linear transformation techniques such as PCA and LDA. Despite my excitement over LDA, hence reflective naming, I understand that instances with small samples would favor the use of unsupervised learning. Grid search was also employed for parameter tuning and optimization.
